- [ ] Explore, don't dive, into the idea of maybe rewriting rust core in TypeScript, with some crates written in Rust. The compilation times just aren't feasible long term. I'd rather do it before a release than after
  - More than speed, I care about reliability and memory footprint. Reliability is not really at risk imo, but memory foot print would likely be.
- [x] Consolidate some GH specific files to `.github`
- [x] Change `common` to `packages`
- [ ] ESLint
  - [x] Add the base configuration
  - [ ] Fix ESLint errors after setup (expect a lot)
- [ ] Add moon?
  - Rust-heavy project, so it might not be worth my time or make sense
  - https://github.com/moonrepo/moon
- [ ] Nix?
- [ ] Reorganize and consolidate some of the `client` code, its _very_ messy
- [ ] Remove the `stump.service` file from GH and just add section in docs with that content
- [ ] Consolidate some of the config files
- [ ] Migrate to Axum v0.6
  - Rebase `axum-upgrade` branch once above chores completed
  - https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/releases/tag/axum-v0.6.0
  - [ ] Consider using https://github.com/maxcountryman/axum-login
- [ ] Look into sqlite session store at some point to replace the in memory store.
- [ ] Move `prisma` out of `core`?
- [ ] Change HTTP endpoints to be **unpaged** by default
- [ ] Rethink HTTP endpoints allow better range of filter options
- [ ] Rework `integration_tests` and add unit testing throughout
  - Mock client inbound -> https://github.com/Brendonovich/prisma-client-rust/issues/230
- [ ] Add better validation via https://github.com/Keats/validator
- [ ] Refactor UI sidebar and main container to support resizing via https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels
- [ ] Either use the `optional_struct` dependency or look into https://github.com/Nukesor/inter-struct (or maybe both?)
- [ ] Refine Stump color palette (gray colors are :barf:)
- [ ] Start building out, but don't use quite yet, custom UI components in new package `components`
- [ ] Get major UI sections completed to MVP stage:
  - [ ] Homepage sections
    - [x] Continue Reading, Recently Added, Etc.
    - [ ] Statistics
  - [ ] Book overview page
    - [ ] Show progress (if any)
    - [ ] Show more series information
  - [ ] Series overview section (on 0th page when browsing a series)
  - [ ] Settings pages
- [ ] Add redirects for unauthed access
  - I.e. if I visit `/some-page/1`, and get redirected to `/auth`, should redirect instead with query params to restore state: `/auth?redirect=/some-page/1`
- [ ] Finish implementing EPUB support
  - [ ] Queries in `client`
  - [ ] Lots of parsing in `core`
  - [ ] Tracking progress
- [ ] Finish implementing Stump Readers:
  - [ ] ImageBased
  - [ ] AnimatedImageBased
  - [ ] EPUB
- [ ] Tighten logging noise
- [ ] Tighten some of the meh config files
  - [ ] Looking at you messy tsconfigs
- [ ] Revisit rework of `StumpConfig`
- [ ] Setup self hosted runner using gaming computer
- [ ] Finish GH workflows/actions
- [ ] Add some automated system for versioning/releases
