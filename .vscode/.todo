- [ ] remove prelude crate and put all the structs/enums/etc in corresponding files
  - [ ] things only used in `apps/server` should be moved there, rather than living in `core`
- [ ] explore https://prisma.brendonovich.dev/extra/partial-types
- [ ] start documenting code better!!
  - honestly it will be much easier I think 1. to maintain and 2. to onboard new contributors if everything and every decision is documented
