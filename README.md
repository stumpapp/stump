> **🚧 Disclaimer 🚧**: Stump is under active development and is an ongoing **WIP**. Anyone is welcome to try it out, but **DO NOT** expect a fully featured or bug-free experience. If you'd like to contribute and help expedite feature development, please review the [developer guide](#developer-guide-).

## Roadmap 🗺

The following items are the major targets for Stump's first stable release:

- 📃 Full OPDS + OPDS Page Streaming support
- 📕 EPUB, PDF, and CBZ/CBR support
- 📚 Organize libraries with collections and reading lists
- 🔐 Granular access-control with managed user accounts
- 🚀 Easy setup and deployment using Docker or bare metal
- 👀 Fully responsive, built-in UI with a dark mode
- 🏃 Low resource utilization with excellent performance
- 🧰 Easily consumable and documented REST API, so community tools and scripts can interact with Stump
- 🌏 Language support _(look [here](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/106))_
- 🌈 And more!

Things you can expect to see afterwards:

- 🖥️ Cross-platform desktop app _(Windows, Mac, Linux)_
- 📖 [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/stumpapp/tachiyomi-extensions) support
- 📱 In-house mobile app _(Android, iOS)_
- 🔎 Versitile full-text search _(blocked by [prisma#9414](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/9414))_
- 👥 Configurable book clubs _(see [this issue](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/120))_

Feel free to reach out if you have anything else you'd like to see!

## Getting Started 🚀

Stump isn't ready for normal usage yet. To give it a spin, it is recommended to try the nightly [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/aaronleopold/stump). If you're interested in development, or trying it from source, you can follow the [developer guide](#developer-guide-).

For more information about getting started, check out the [guides](https://stumpapp.dev/guides) available on the Stump website.

## Developer Guide 💻

Contributions are very **welcome**! Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/tree/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

A quick summary of the steps required to get going:

1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
   - If you're running Windows, you will need [Visual C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
   - If you're running macOS on Apple Silicon, you'll need to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861)
2. Install [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch)
3. Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/system-setup.sh
   ```

   This isn't strictly necessary, and is mostly beneficial for Linux users (it installs some system dependencies). Feel free to skip this step if you'd like, and instead just run:

   ```bash
   yarn run setup
   ```

   This will build the React app, generate the Prisma client, and generate the Rust-TypeScript types. To do any of these individually, you can run:

   ```bash
    # build the React app
    yarn web build
    # generate the Prisma client and Rust-TypeScript types
    cargo codegen # or cargo prisma generate --schema=./core/prisma/schema.prisma for just the Prisma client
   ```

4. Start one of the apps:

   A few example commands are:

   ```bash
   # run the webapp + server
   yarn dev:web
   # run the desktop app + server
   yarn start:desktop
   # run the docs website
   yarn docs dev
   ```

   Or just `cargo` for the server (and other Rust apps):

   ```bash
   cargo run --package stump_server --bin stump_server
   ```

And that's it!

#### Where to start?

If you aren't sure where to start, I recommend taking a look at [open issues](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues). You can also check out the [current project board](https://github.com/orgs/stumpapp/projects/4) to see what's actively being worked on or planned.

In general, the following areas are good places to start:

- Translation, so Stump is accessible to as many people as possible
  - [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/stump) is used for translations
- Writing comprehensive tests
- Designing and/improving UI/UX
- Docker build optimizations, caching, etc
- CI pipelines, automated releases and release notes, etc
- And lots more!

## Project Structure 📦

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>
  
Stump has a monorepo structure managed by [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) and [cargo workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html). The project is split into a number of different packages and crates, each with their own purpose:

### Apps

Stand-alone applications that can be run independently, at `/apps` in the root of the project:

- `desktop`: A React + Tauri desktop application
- `expo`: A React Native application ([#125](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/125))
- `server`: An [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) HTTP server
- `web`: A React application, the primary UI for both the built-in web app the server serves and the desktop app

The only exception to this is the `docs` app, which is a NextJS application and is located at `/docs` in the root of the project.

### Core

A Rust crate containing Stump's core functionalities, at `/core` in the root of the project

### Crates

Various Rust crates, at `/crates` in the root of the project:

- `cli`: A CLI library used in the `server` app
- `codegen`: A small rust app that handles all of the code generation for Stump
- `integrations`: A rust library containing integrations with other notification services
- `prisma-cli`: A small wrapper rust app to run the Prisma CLI

### Docs

A NextJS application for the Stump documentation site at `/docs` in the root of the project

### Packages

Various TypeScript packages, at `/packages` in the root of the project:

- `sdk`: A TypeScript SDK for interfacing with Stump's API
- `client`: React-query config, hooks, and other client-side utilities for React-based applications
- `components`: Shared React components for the web and desktop applications
- `browser`: A React component that is essentially the "main" UI for Stump on browser-based platforms. This package is shared between both the `web` and `desktop` apps
- `types`: Shared TypeScript types generated by the various codegen tools in the project
