> **üöß Disclaimer üöß**: Stump is under active development and is an ongoing **WIP**. Anyone is welcome to try it out, but **do not** expect a fully featured, bug-free experience. Some features will be missing and/or broken. Additionally, I will likely flatten the migrations immediately prior to the `0.1.0` release, which would break existing Stump databases. If you'd like to contribute and help expedite Stump's first release, please review the [developer guide](#developing-). Otherwise, stay tuned!

## Roadmap üó∫

The following items are the major targets for Stump's first release:

- üìÉ Full OPDS + OPDS Page Streaming support
- üìï EPUB, PDF, and CBZ/CBR support
- üìö Organize libraries with collections and reading lists
- üîê Role-based access-control with managed user accounts
- üöÄ Easy setup and deployment using Docker or bare metal
- üëÄ Fully responsive, built-in UI with a dark mode
- üèÉ Low resource utilization with excellent performance
- üß∞ Easily consumable and documented REST API, so community tools and scripts can interact with Stump
- üåè Language support _(see [this issue](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/issues/106))_
- üåà And more!

Things you can expect to see after the first release:

- üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform desktop app _(Windows, Mac, Linux)_
- üìñ [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/stumpapp/tachiyomi-extensions) support
- üì± In-house mobile app _(Android, iOS)_
- üîé Versitile full-text search _(blocked by [prisma#9414](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/9414))_
- üë• Configurable book clubs _(see [this issue](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/issues/120))_

I am very open to suggestions and ideas, so feel free to reach out if you have anything you'd like to see!

> For more, feel free to view the [FAQ](https://stumpapp.dev/faq) page. If you're interested in tracking the development of specific features, you can take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/issues).

## Getting Started üöÄ

Stump isn't ready for normal usage yet. For now, follow the [Developing](#developing-) section to build from source and run locally, or use the nightly [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/aaronleopold/stump) to give it a try.

For more information about getting started, how Stump works, how it manages your library, and much more, please visit [stumpapp.dev](https://stumpapp.dev/guides).

## Developer Guide üíª

Contributions are very **encouraged** and **welcome**! Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/tree/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

A quick summary of the steps required to get going:

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   - If you're running Windows, you will need [Visual C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
   - If you're running macOS on Apple Silicon, you'll need to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861)
2. Install [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch)
3. Run the setup:

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

4. Start one of the apps:

I use [moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/) for Stump's repository management

```bash
# webapp + server
moon run server:dev web:dev
# desktop app + server
moon run server:start desktop:dev
# docs website
moon run docs:dev
```

And that's it!

#### Where to start?

If you aren't sure where to start, I recommend taking a look at [open issues](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/issues) and the [task board](https://github.com/users/aaronleopold/projects/2). This is where I track the broader development items for Stump. It is mostly for my own personal organization, but should still hopefully give you an idea of what needs to be done.

You can also check out the [milestones](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/milestones) page for a more curated list of issues that need to be addressed. I typically organize issues into milestones based on the non-patch version they will be released in.

Some other good places to start:

- Translation, so Stump is accessible to non-English speakers.
  - An automated translation system would be immensely helpful! If you're knowledgeable in this area, please reach out!
- Writing comprehensive tests.
- Designing UI elements/sections or improving the existing UI/UX.
- Docker build optimizations, caching, etc.
- CI pipelines, automated releases and release notes, etc.
- And lots more!

## Similar Projects üëØ

There are a number of other projects that are similar to Stump, it certainly isn't the first or only digital book media server out there. If Stump isn't for you, or you want to check out similar projects in the rust and/or self hosting spaces, consider checking out these other open source projects:

- [audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) (_Audio books, Podcasts_)
- [Dim](https://github.com/Dusk-Labs/dim) (_Video, Audio_) (‚ú®*Rust*‚ú®)
- [Kavita](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita)
- [Komga](https://github.com/gotson/komga)
- [oqurum](https://github.com/oqurum) (‚ú®*Rust*‚ú®)

## Acknowledgements üôè

- [Komga](https://github.com/gotson/komga) is a huge inspiration for Stump, an amazing comics/manga media server written in Kotlin.
- [Brendonovich](https://github.com/Brendonovich) for building [prisma client rust](https://github.com/Brendonovich/prisma-client-rust), which allows me to use Prisma with Rust. Stump originally used SeaORM, but the DX simply can't compare to Prisma.
