Stump has a built-in access control systems that allows you to manage who has access to what. This is done through a combination of methods, including:

- Age restrictions
- Tag-based restrictions

## Age restrictions

Age restrictions are set on a per-user basis, and are used to determine whether or not a user can access a book. For more information on user management, see the [User Management](/guides/user-management) page.

### How age restrictions are represented

The way age restrictions can be represented vary, but Stump aims to support as many as possible and convert it to a common format used internally. Stump treats the age restriction as a minimum age, meaning that if a user has an age restriction set to `13` and a book is rated to `17`, the user will not be able to access the book.

The following source formats are supported:

- `G / PG / PG-13 / R / X` - The MPAA rating system, maps to the following:
  - `G` - `0`
  - `PG` - `0` (TBD maybe change to `7`?)
  - `PG-13` - `13`
  - `R` - `17`
  - `X` - `18`
- `All ages / Teen / Mature / Explicit` - More of common phrases, maps to the following:
  - `All ages` - `0`
  - `Teen` - `13`
  - `Mature` - `17`
  - `Explicit` - `18`
- `{number} and up` - A number followed by `and up`, maps to the number itself. E.g. `13 and up` maps to `13`.
- `{number}+` - A number followed by a `+`, maps to the number itself. E.g. `13+` maps to `13`.
- `{number}-{number}` - A range of numbers, maps to the first number in the range. E.g. `13-17` maps to `13`.
- `{number}` - Just a number, maps to the number itself. E.g. `13` maps to `13`.

### Where does Stump get the age restrictions from?

The age restriction is located directly within the metadata for a book itself, or on a book's series' metadata. Stump will attempt to parse this value from the metadata and store it internally as a number.

### How does Stump determine whether or not a book is age-allowed?

If a book or a book's series has an age restriction set, Stump will use that age restriction to determine whether or not a user can access it. The comparison done internally is `less than or equal to X number`, meaning that if a user has an age restriction set to `13` and a book is rated to `17`, the user will not be able to access the book. If a user has an age restriction set to `17` and a book is rated to `13`, the user will be able to access the book. In other words, **the age restriction set on the user must be greater than or equal to the age restriction number set on the book or series in order to have access**.

If a book doesn't have an age restriction set, but a user with an age restriction attempts to access it, Stump will use the following logic to determine whether or not the book is allowed:

- If the book is part of a series, and that series has an age restriction set, that age restriction will be used
- If neither the book nor the series has an age restriction set, the book will be considered allowed **unless** a user has an age restriction configuration with the `restrict_on_unset` option set to `true`. See the [User Management](/guides/user-management) page for more information on user configuration.

Stump doesn't currently support editing metadata directly, but it is planned for the future! For now, if you need to set age restrictions on your books, you'll need to use a third-party tool to edit the metadata, then re-scan your library.

### Other considerations

- Stump doesn't currently support dynamic thumbnails for libraries containing age-restricted books or series. This means that if it happens to be the case that the first book in the first series of a library is age-restricted, the thumbnail for the library **will still be displayed** so long as a user has access to the library. This is planned to be fixed in the future by one of two ways:
  1. Settings will be made available to override the thumbnail for a library or series
  2. Server owners will be able to associate libraries and series with tags and then set restrictions on a user that would prevent access to specific tags. See the [Tag-based restrictions](#tag-based-restrictions) section for more information.
