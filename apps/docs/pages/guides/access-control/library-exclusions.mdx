# Library Exclusions

A user can be explicitly excluded from seeing a library. This is useful for hiding libraries that contain content that a user should not see, such as age-restricted content or content that is not relevant to them.

## Configure Exclusions

	This functionality is gated behind the `library:manage` and `user:read` user permissions. To learn
	more about permissions, see the [permissions](/guides/access-control/permissions) guide.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Navigate to the library settings

Navigate to the library you want to exclude the user from and click on the `Settings` tab.

### Select `Access Control` in the sidebar

The `Exclusions` section is located towards the bottom of the settings page. It contains a multi-select dropdown that allows you to select the users you want to exclude from the library.

### Select the user(s) to exclude

Use the multi-select dropdown to select the user you want to exclude from the library. You can select multiple users if you want to exclude more than one user.

### Save your changes

Autosave is enabled, so any changes should take effect immediately. Any user excluded from a library will no longer have access to the library or any content within it.
