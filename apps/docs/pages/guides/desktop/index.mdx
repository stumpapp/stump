# Desktop App

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
	At the time of writing, the desktop app has a **nightly** release available on
	[GitHub](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/releases/tag/untagged-dcf8ed03bb6a19b142e0). It is not
	stable, will contain bugs, and not feature complete. However if you decide to try it, please
	report any issues you encounter!

The very same app you use in your browser, but with added features:

- **Standalone**: No need to keep a browser tab open
- **Discord Rich Presence**: Show off what you're doing in Stump to your friends
- **Bundled Server**: Run your Stump server from the app itself, so you don't need to configure one separately
- **Multiple Instances**: Connect to as many Stump instances as you want
