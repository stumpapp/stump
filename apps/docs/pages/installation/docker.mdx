# Docker

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
	Stump currently only has a [nightly build](https://hub.docker.com/r/aaronleopold/stump) available
	for Docker. **This image is geared for testing, potentially lacking in both features and
	reliability**, so do not expect a fully featured, bug-free experience if you spin up a container.
</Callout>

## Usage

You have two options for spinning up a container based on your preference. I prefer using compose, however I have listed instructions for both Docker CLI and Docker Compose below.

Please ensure to adjust `PUID` and `PGID` to the user your config and data directories belong to.
You can print those by executing: `echo -e "PUID=$(id -u)\nPGID=$(id -g)"`

### Using docker run

You can create a container by running:

```bash
# replace my paths (left of colon) with your own
docker create \
  --name=stump \
  -e "PUID=1000" \
  -e "PGID=1000" \
  -p 10801:10801 \
  --volume "/Users/aaronleopold/.stump:/config" \
  --volume "/Users/aaronleopold/Documents/Stump:/data" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  aaronleopold/stump
```

If you prefer bind mounts, you can swap out the two `--volume` lines with:

```bash
--mount type=volume,source=/Users/aaronleopold/.stump,target=/config \
--mount type=volume,source=/Users/aaronleopold/Documents/Stump,target=/data \
```

Then you can start the container:

```bash
docker start stump
```

#### Properties and configuration

| Parameter                       |                                Functionality                                |
| ------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `--name=stump`                  |           Sets the name of the container this command will create           |
| `-e "PUID=1000" -e "PGID=1000"` |    Sets the user and group used within the container (leave this as is)     |
| `-p 10801:10801`                | Maps the port on your machine (left) to the port the container uses (right) |

### Using docker compose

<Callout emoji="☢️">
	This tutorial uses the newer `docker compose` CLI. If you find this command does not exist for
	you, you might be on V1, which uses `docker-compose`. Please review [Docker's
	documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for more information and/or
	platform-specific installation.
</Callout>

Below is an example of a Docker Compose file you can use to bootstrap your Stump server:

```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
  stump:
    image: aaronleopold/stump
    container_name: stump
    # Replace my paths (prior to the colons) with your own
    volumes:
      - /Users/aaronleopold/.stump:/config
      - /Users/aaronleopold/Documents/Stump:/data
    ports:
      - 10801:10801
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      # This `environment` field is optional, remove if you don't need it.
      # I am using it as an example here, but it's actually a default value.
      - STUMP_CONFIG_DIR=/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Monitoring

To monitor the logs of the container, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f stump
```

## Updating your container

As with starting Stump, updating your container is slightly different depending on how you chose to run it.

### Update using docker CLI

1. Update the image: `docker pull aaronleopold/stump`
2. Stop the running container: `docker stop stump`
3. Delete the container: `docker rm stump`
4. Recreate your container (see [using-docker-run](#using-docker-run))
5. Start the new container: `docker start stump`

To remove the old dangling images you have installed: `docker image prune`

### Update using docker compose

1. Stop the running container: `docker compose down`
2. Update the image: `docker compose pull` or `docker compose pull aaronleopold/stump`
3. Start the container again: `docker-compose up`
