# Stump Mobile Application

This is the mobile application for the Stump. It is built with [Expo](https://expo.io/), and is currently in the very early stages of development.

## Getting Started üöÄ

> Note: You need to have the Expo CLI installed, as well as the mobile SDKs (depending on where you want to run the app). See the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) for more info.

1. Clone the repo
2. Follow the [developer guide](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump#developer-guide-) at the root of the Stump monorepo
3. Start the mobile app and the server:

```bash
moon run server:start mobile:dev # or server:dev if you want to run the server in dev mode
```

And that's it!
