// ^ There is a bug in clippy after updating the toolchain. I am subscribed to the issue,
// and will remove this once it is resolved.
#![allow(clippy::blocks_in_conditions)]
// This job module would not be possible without other awesome projects in the Rust ecosystem! They
// taught me a lot, and I don't think I could have done this without them. Taking bits and pieces from
// each of them, I was able to create a job system that is both flexible and powerful:
// - https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive --> The most impressive and influential one, the concept of jobs having typed tasks executed one-by-one in a loop, in addition to the handling logic for pause/resume, came from here
// - https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/background-jobs --> Trait design (v similar to above) and how they handle retries
// - https://github.com/ZeroAssumptions/aide-de-camp
// 		- Also their writeup on the fundamentals of their design: https://dev.to/zeroassumptions/build-a-job-queue-with-rust-using-aide-de-camp-part-1-4g5m
