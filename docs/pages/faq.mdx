## What is Stump?

Stump is an open source, self hostable, media server for digital books (ebooks, comic books, manga, etc). It is designed to be _easy to use_ and _easy to deploy_.

The short on how it works:

- Install and run Stump on a computer or NAS (Network Attached Storage).
- Configure your libraries
- Read your media using the web interface or any compatible client

Stump **is not** a tool used for fetching or downloading any kind of media. It is a tool used to host and access **your own media**. Think of it like a personal Netflix for comic books/manga/etc that lives on a computer in your home.

## Motivations

There are some really solid, self-hostable, OPDS media servers out there. I started out using [Komga](https://komga.org). I initially started developing Stump because I thought it would be cool to learn what goes into making something like Komga myself.

In general, Stump strives for the following:

- Small footprint and low resource usage
- Efficiency and performance, even on less powerful hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Intuitive, pretty, and easy to use interface
- Wide format support (e.g., PDF, EPUB, CBZ/CBR)

## Compatibility

Stump _should_ work on all major browsers and operating systems.

Generally speaking, 1GB of RAM and disk space is enough. Stump also runs well on low-powered ARM-based single board computers, such as a Raspberry Pi.

## Roadmap

Take a look at the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/stumpapp/projects) to see what is currently being worked on and what is planned for the future.

If you're interested in tracking the broader development of individual or otherwise isolated features, you can take a look at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues).
