# Age Restrictions

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">

Age restrictions are set on a per-user basis, and are used to determine whether or not a user can access a book. For more information on users and user management, see the dedicated [users](/guides/access-control/users) page.

### Supported age restrictions representations

The way age restrictions can be represented vary, but Stump aims to support as many as possible and convert it to a common format to be used internally.

Stump treats the age restriction as a **minimum age**. This means that if a user has an age restriction set to `13`,and a given book is rated at `17`, the user will not be able to access the book.

The following source formats are supported:

- `G / PG / PG-13 / R / X` - The MPAA rating system, maps to the following:
  - `G` - `0`
  - `PG` - `0` (TBD maybe change to `7`?)
  - `PG-13` - `13`
  - `R` - `17`
  - `X` - `18`
- `All ages / Teen / Mature / Explicit` - More of common phrases, maps to the following:
  - `All ages` - `0`
  - `Teen` - `13`
  - `Mature` - `17`
  - `Explicit` - `18`
- `{number} and up` - A number followed by `and up`, maps to the number itself. E.g. `13 and up` maps to `13`.
- `{number}+` - A number followed by a `+`, maps to the number itself. E.g. `13+` maps to `13`.
- `{number}-{number}` - A range of numbers, maps to the first number in the range. E.g. `13-17` maps to `13`.
- `{number}` - Just a number, maps to the number itself. E.g. `13` maps to `13`.

### Where does Stump get the age restrictions from?

The age restriction is located directly within the metadata for a book itself, or on a book's series' metadata. Stump will attempt to parse this value from the metadata and store it internally as a number (see above).

This means that **without metadata, Stump cannot determine whether or not a book is age-allowed**. There are fallback options described below.

### How does Stump determine whether or not a book is age-allowed?

If a book or a book's series has an age restriction set, Stump will use that age restriction to determine whether or not a user can access it. The comparison done internally is `less than or equal to X number`, meaning that if a user has an age restriction set to `13` and a book is rated to `17`, the user will not be able to access the book. If a user has an age restriction set to `17` and a book is rated to `13`, the user will be able to access the book. In other words, **the age restriction set on the user must be greater than or equal to the age restriction number set on the book or series in order to have access**.

If a book doesn't have an age restriction set, but a user with an age restriction attempts to access it, Stump will use the following logic to determine whether or not the book is allowed:

- If the book is part of a series, and that series has an age restriction set, that age restriction will be used
- If neither the book nor the series has an age restriction set, the book will be considered allowed **unless** a user has an age restriction configuration with the `restrict_on_unset` option set to `true`.

Stump doesn't currently support editing metadata directly, but it is planned for the future! For now, if you need to set age restrictions on your books, you'll need to use a third-party tool to edit the metadata, then re-scan your library. The updated timestamp on the file should trigger an update of the metadata in Stump.

### Other considerations

- Stump doesn't currently support dynamic thumbnails for libraries containing age-restricted books or series. This means that if it happens to be the case that the first book in the first series of a library is age-restricted, the thumbnail for the library **will still be displayed** so long as a user has access to the library. This is planned to be fixed in the future by one of two ways:
  1. Settings will be made available to override the thumbnail for a library or series
  2. Server owners will be able to associate libraries and series with tags and then set restrictions on a user that would prevent access to specific tags. See the [Tag-based restrictions](#tag-based-restrictions) section for more information.
  3. Server owners can exclude users from seeing certain libraries entirely
