# Library Exclusions

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">This functionality is not fully implemented yet. Check back soon!</Callout>

A user can be explicitly excluded from seeing a library. This is useful for hiding libraries that contain content that a user should not see, such as age-restricted content or content that is not relevant to them.

## How to exclude a user from a library

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">This will require `library:manage` permissions</Callout>

<Steps>

### Navigate to the library settings

Navigate to the library you want to exclude the user from and click on the `Settings` tab.

### Scroll to the `Exclusions` section

The `Exclusions` section is located towards the bottom of the settings page. It contains a multi-select dropdown that allows you to select the users you want to exclude from the library.

### Select the user(s) to exclude

Use the multi-select dropdown to select the user you want to exclude from the library. You can select multiple users if you want to exclude more than one user.

### Save your changes

This should be immediately reflected, the user will no longer have access to:

- The library
- Any content within the library
