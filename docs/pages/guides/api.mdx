# REST API

Stump exposes a REST API that allows you to interact with your Stump server.

## Authentication

### Sessions

Stump uses server-side sessions to authenticate users. These sessions are stored in the database, and are automatically cleaned up within 60 seconds of expiring. You can change the expiry cleanup check interval by setting the `SESSION_EXPIRY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` environment variable. See the [configuration guide](/guides/configuration) for more information.

### Basic Authentication

	This functionality is only available on OPDS endpoints. You cannot authenticate with Basic
	Authentication on the REST API
</Callout>

Stump supports [Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) in order to properly support OPDS clients. Authenticating using this method will still create a server-side session for you.

### JWT Access Tokens

	This functionality is not fully implemented and subject to change. You can track the progress on
	this feature in [this issue](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/219)
</Callout>

Short-lived JWT access tokens are available for API access, aimed at better enabling third-party applications and extensions to interact with Stump. While you can generate these tokens and use them to authenticate API requests, the API is still in development and subject to change. Once the API is more stable, we will provide more relevant documentation on how to generate and use these tokens.

## Swagger UI

Stump's REST API is documented using Swagger. You can access Swagger UI by visiting visiting `http(s)://your-server(:10801)/swagger-ui`. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, you can read more about it [here](https://swagger.io/). Under the hood, Stump uses [utoipa](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa) for semi-automated Swagger generation. If you find any issues or inconsistencies with the API options available while using the Swagger UI, please open an [issue](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues) outlining the problem.

### Disabling Swagger UI

If you don't want to expose Swagger UI, you can disable it by setting the `ENABLE_SWAGGER_UI` environment variable to `false`. See the [configuration guide](/guides/configuration) for more information.
