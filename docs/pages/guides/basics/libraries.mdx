# Libraries

There are a couple key concepts to go over regarding how Stump represents libraries:

- Libraries are really just paths on your computer that contain subdirectories representing series of books.
- A library paths _must_ be recursively unique. This means if you have a library at `/books`, you cannot have a library at `/books/comics`.

As long as a directory is accessible by Stump, and abides by the above specification, you can create a library with it. This allows for convenient configurations like network drives, etc.

## Supported Patterns

There are way too many varying organizational preferences for Stump to support all of them. Instead, Stump supports two different patterns for organizing your library:

- **Collection-Priority**: Takes the top most folders and collapses their contents into it as a single series.
- **Series-Priority**: Will create a separate series for each folder that directly contains media files, not just the top most folder.

</Callout>

### Collection-Priority

A collection-priority library is useful for libraries that have many nested folders that you'd like to be grouped by the top most folder. **Only direct descendants of the library root will be considered for series creation**, so long as they contain media files at some point in their hierarchy.

### Series-Priority

A series-priority library is useful for libraries which should be grouped by any directory that directly contains media files. **Any descendant directories (including the library root itself) will be considered for series creation**, so long as they directly contain media files.

### Examples

A few examples to help illustrate the difference between the two library patterns and how Stump will interpret their differing structures.

#### Example 1

Consider the following file tree:

<FileTree>
	<FileTree.Folder name="Ebooks" defaultOpen>
		<FileTree.Folder name="Shannon, Samantha" defaultOpen>
			<FileTree.File name="The Priory of the Orange Tree.epub" />
		</FileTree.Folder>

    	<FileTree.Folder name="Sanderson, Brandon" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Elantris.epub" />
            <FileTree.Folder name="Mistborn" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 01 - The Final Empire (epub).epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 02 - The Well of Ascension (epub).epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 03 - The Hero of Ages (epub).epub" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
    	</FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="J.R.R. Tolkien" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="The Lord of the Rings" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="The Fellowship of the Ring.epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="The Two Towers.epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="The Return of the King.epub" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>

</FileTree>

When Stump scans this library as a collection-priority library, it will create 3 series:

1. _Shannon, Samantha_
2. _Sanderson, Brandon_
3. _J.R.R. Tolkien_.

When Stump scans this library as a series-priority library, it will create 4 series:

1. _Shannon, Samantha_
2. _Sanderson, Brandon_
3. _Mistborn_
4. _The Lord of the Rings_.

Below is a visualization of this library in Stump, using a file tree for simplicity:

<Tabs items={['Collection priority', 'Series priority']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

<FileTree>
	<FileTree.Folder name="Ebooks" defaultOpen>
		<FileTree.Folder name="Shannon, Samantha" defaultOpen>
			<FileTree.File name="The Priory of the Orange Tree.epub" />
		</FileTree.Folder>

    	<FileTree.Folder name="Sanderson, Brandon" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Elantris.epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 01 - The Final Empire (epub).epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 02 - The Well of Ascension (epub).epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 03 - The Hero of Ages (epub).epub" />
    	</FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="J.R.R. Tolkien" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="The Fellowship of the Ring.epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="The Two Towers.epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="The Return of the King.epub" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>

</FileTree>

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Ebooks" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="Shannon, Samantha" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="The Priory of the Orange Tree.epub" />
        </FileTree.Folder>

    	<FileTree.Folder name="Sanderson, Brandon" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Elantris.epub" />
    	</FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="Mistborn" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 01 - The Final Empire (epub).epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 02 - The Well of Ascension (epub).epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 03 - The Hero of Ages (epub).epub" />
        </FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="The Lord of the Rings" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="The Fellowship of the Ring.epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="The Two Towers.epub" />
            <FileTree.File name="The Return of the King.epub" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>

</FileTree>

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

#### Example 2

Consider the following file tree:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Comics" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="Daredevil" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Daredevil 001.cbz" />
            <FileTree.File name="Daredevil 002.cbz" />
        </FileTree.Folder>

    	<FileTree.Folder name="The Amazing Spider-Man (2018)" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="The Amazing Spider-Man 001 (2018).cbz" />
            <FileTree.File name="The Amazing Spider-Man 002 (2018).cbz" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>

</FileTree>

When Stump scans this library as a series-priority library, it will create 2 series:

1. _Daredevil_
2. _The Amazing Spider-Man (2018)_.

In this particular case, a collection-priority library would produce the same result, as there are no nested folders. The representation is also identical to the file tree, above!

#### Complicated Example

Let's consider the following file tree:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Ebooks" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="Martin, George R R" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="A Song of Ice and Fire" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="A Dance With Dragons (2012).epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="A Feast for Crows (2005).epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="A Game of Thrones (2011).epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="A Storm of Swords (2003).epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="Fire and Blood (2018).epub" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="Sanderson, Brandon" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Elantris.epub" />
            <FileTree.Folder name="The Mistborn" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="Secret History.epub" />
                <FileTree.Folder name="The Mistborn (Era 1)" defaultOpen>
                    <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 01 - The Final Empire (epub).epub" />
                    <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 02 - The Well of Ascension (epub).epub" />
                    <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 03 - The Hero of Ages (epub).epub" />
                </FileTree.Folder>
                <FileTree.Folder name="The Mistborn (Era 2)" defaultOpen>
                    <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 04 - The Alloy of Law (epub).epub" />
                    <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 05 - Shadows of Self (epub).epub" />
                    <FileTree.File name="Mistborn 06 - The Bands of Mourning (epub).epub" />
                </FileTree.Folder>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="Tolkien, J R R" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Hobbit Or There and Back Again (1986).epub" />
            <FileTree.Folder name="The Lord of the Rings" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="The Fellowship of the Ring.epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="The Two Towers.epub" />
                <FileTree.File name="The Return of the King.epub" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>

</FileTree>

Notice how I started mixing stand alone novels and book series, grouping the book series by folders, for each author.

When Stump scans this library as a collection-priority library, it will create 3 series:

1. _Martin, George R R_
2. _Sanderson, Brandon_
3. _Tolkien, J R R_.

When Stump scans this library as a series-priority library, it will create 7 series:

1. _A Song of Ice and Fire_
2. _Sanderson, Brandon_
3. _Mistborn_
4. _The Mistborn (Era 1)_
5. _The Mistborn (Era 2)_
6. _Tolkien, J R R_
7. _The Lord of the Rings_.

Below is a visualization of this library in Stump, using a file tree for simplicity:

### Choosing a Pattern

There is no right and wrong when it comes to configuring a library as either collection-priority or series-priority. It's all about preference.

In general, if you plan on having nested folders in your library that can be grouped by the upper most level, then you should use a collection-priority library. If your library is flat, or you don't want to group books by the upper most level, then you should use a series-priority library.

Personally, I use a collection-priority library for my ebooks and a series-priority library for my comics. I find that the collection-priority library works well for ebooks, as I can group them all by author, regardless of how I organize the underlying filesystem, and the series-priority library works well for comics, as I can group them by major arcs.

#### Alternative Options

Unfortunately, Stump does not support any other patterns, as there are simply too many ways to organize a library to support them all. If you have a library that doesn't quite fit either of these patterns, or you just prefer a different organization method, you can always use the [File Explorer](/guides/features/file-explorer) to navigate your library. This is akin to using a native file explorer to navigate your filesystem.

## Deleting a Library

> Deleting a library will remove all of the series, books, and other entities associated with the books (e.g. read progress, reading lists, etc) contained within it. Your actual files will not be deleted, but they will no longer exist in Stump.
>
> **This action cannot be undone.**

You can delete a library from the library selection menu on the sidebar, or by navigating to the library's deletion settings page (`/settings/delete`).

## Populating your Library

When you create a library, you can choose to initiate the initial scan immediately. A scan indexes your filesystem, relative to the library's configured base path, and syncs discovered media information with Stump's database.

To manually initiate a scan job, you can click the action button library selection menu on the sidebar and select "Scan". You may also navigate to the library's scanning settings page (`/settings/scanning`) and click the "Scan" button there.

For more thorough information on library scans, see the [filesystem scanning](/guides/filesystem-scans) guide.
