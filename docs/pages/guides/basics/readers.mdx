# Built-in Readers

Stump has a few different built-in readers that you can use to read your books. Each reader is designed to be used with a specific type of book, and they all have their own unique features.

## Ebook Reader

A reader for reading ebooks, such as `.epub` files.

	At the time of writing, ebooks are eagarly loaded for the reader, meaning your server will send
	the entire book to your client. This is far from ideal, and a [streamable ebook
	reader](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/62) is planned for a future release so ebook
	reading sessions can be more network friendly.

## Image-based Reader

A reader for reading image based books. These are valid archive files, such as `.cbz`/`zip` and `.cbr`/`rar` files.

### Page-based Reader

A reader that displays each page one at a time.

> Wow, such empty. Much sad.

### Continuous scroll Reader

A reader that displays the entire book as one long page, allowing you to scroll through it either vertically or horizontally. Images are virtualized, so you can scroll through a book with hundreds of pages without any performance issues.
