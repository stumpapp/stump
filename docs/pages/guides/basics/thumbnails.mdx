# Thumbnails

Stump uses thumbnails to display images of your media throughout the app. By default, Stump will pull the first image from a media file to use as a thumbnail. However, you can customize this behavior per-library by configuring the thumbnail generation settings

## Thumbnail Generation

The generation of thumbnails is controlled by the configuration options for a library. These options include:

- Explicitly sizing each thumbnail (height and width in pixels)
- Scaling both dimensions of each thumbnail by a factor (e.g. 0.5)
- The format to encode the thumbnail in (e.g. JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF)
- The quality of the encoding (e.g. 0-1.0)

Thumbnail generation is optional, and you can disable it entirely if you prefer to use the default image as a thumbnail.

	The advantage of configuring thumbnail generation is that it allows you to minimize the size of
	thumbnails being sent to the client, which greatly improves performance. Otherwise, the full-size
	image would be sent to the client, which can be very large and slow to load.

### Image Candidacy

When generating thumbnails, Stump will use the very first image it encounters in the media file as the thumbnail.

## Supported Formats

### Generation

Stump supports generating thumbnails to and from the following formats:

- JPEG
- PNG
- WebP
- AVIF

You should ensure that your browser supports the format you plan to use. You can visit the following links to check:

- [WebP](https://caniuse.com/webp)
- [AVIF](https://caniuse.com/avif)

### Display

Stump supports the following formats for displaying thumbnails, in addition to the above:

- [GIF](https://caniuse.com/gif)

The reason for this separation is that while Stump supports rendering these on the UI, there is no process to convert them.

## Management

Thumbnail management can be done in either the settings page associated with a particular entity or in the settings page for the library as a whole. For example:

- `/books/:bookId/manage`
- `/series/:seriesId/settings`
- `/libraries/:libraryId/settings`

### Thumbnail Selection

You have the option to manually select an image as a thumbnail. This is useful when either the automatic selection is incorrect or when you want to use a special image. The selection is done on a media file, so if you are selecting for a:

- `Library`: You will select a particular series, then a particular book, then a particular page
- `Series`: You will select a particular book, then a particular page
- `Book`: You will select a particular page

You may also upload a custom image to use as a thumbnail.

### Regeneration

You have the ability to regenerate thumbnails in a given library's settings page. The options are:

- Generate only missing thumbnails
- Force regenerate all thumbnails

### Deletion

You can delete a thumbnail in a given library's settings page. This will remove all thumbnails associated with the library and its entities.
