# Command-line interface

The Stump server ships with a built-in CLI tool that allows you to manage your server from the command line

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	Every example in this guide assumes you are running the CLI tool from the same directory as the
	executable. You will need to adjust the path to the executable accordingly if you are running it
	from a different location
</Callout>

## Basic Usage

The CLI tool is exposed via a few subcommands using the same executable as the server, itself. To see the available subcommands, run:

```bash copy
./stump --help
```

This will print the various subcommands and options available to you. To see more information about a specific subcommand, run:

```bash copy
./stump <subcommand> --help
```

## Account Management

### Locking a user account

To lock a user account, run:

```bash copy
./stump account lock --username <username>
```

### Unlocking a user account

To unlock a user account, run:

```bash copy
./stump account unlock --username <username>
```

### Resetting a user's password

To reset a user's password, run:

```bash copy
./stump account reset-password --username <username>
```

You will be prompted to enter a new password, with a confirmation prompt to ensure you entered it correctly. The password will be hashed and salted and stored in the database to replace the existing one.
