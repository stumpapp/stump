# Desktop App

Stump's web UI, automatically served by your Stump server instance, is also available as a cross-platform desktop application, so you can use Stump outside your browser with a few added, native features.

## What is the difference between the web UI and the desktop app?

The web UI and the desktop app are essentially the same thing. The desktop app provides a thin wrapper around the React application that is served by the Stump server, using the [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework.

At the time of writing, there are only few desktop-only features, but more are planned. For now, the desktop app provides:

- Optional Discord Rich Presence integration

## Installation

If you want to install the desktop application, you will want to select the appropriate binary for your operating system:

- macOS: `Stump.dmg`
- Linux: `Stump.AppImage`
- Windows: `Stump.exe`
