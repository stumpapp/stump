	This app is not yet available for download. I expect an initial **unstable** release to be
	available towards the end of 2024. Expect bugs and missing features, but stay tuned for updates!
</Callout>

The very same app you use in your browser, but with added features:

- **Standalone**: No need to keep a browser tab open
- **Discord Rich Presence**: Show off what you're doing in Stump to your friends
- **Bundled Server**: Run your Stump server from the app itself, so you don't need to configure one separately
- **Multiple Instances**: Connect to as many Stump instances as you want
