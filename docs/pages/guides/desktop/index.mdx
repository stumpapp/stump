# Desktop App

The desktop is almost identical to the web app which you're already familiar with, but with some added features unique to a native application:

- **Standalone**: No need to open a browser to use Stump
- **Discord Rich Presence**: Show off what you're doing in Stump to your friends
- **Bundled Server**: Run your Stump server from the app itself, so you don't need to configure one separately
- **Multiple Instances**: Connect to as many Stump instances as you want

## Installation

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
	At the time of writing, the desktop app has a **nightly** release available on
	[GitHub](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/releases/tag/untagged-dcf8ed03bb6a19b142e0). It is not
	stable, will contain bugs, and not feature complete. However if you decide to try it, please
	report any issues you encounter!
</Callout>

The desktop app is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Once stable releases are available, this page will be updated with the appropriate download links.

## Planned Features

The desktop app is still in its infancy, and as such there are other features planned for the future. Some of these include:

- **Offline Mode**: Read your books offline without needing to connect to a server
- **Granular Discord Rich Presence**: Choose exactly what you want to show off to your friends. At the time of writing, it only shows that you are in the app
