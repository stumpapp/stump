# Desktop App

<Callout emoji="🚧">
	This app is still in development, and is not yet available for download. I expect an initial
	release to be available towards the end of 2024 for macOS and Linux users. Unfortunately, Windows
	users will have to wait a little longer (see [#219](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/219))
</Callout>

The very same app you use in your browser, but with added features:

- **Standalone**: No need to keep a browser tab open
- **Discord Rich Presence**: Show off what you're doing in Stump to your friends, if you want
- **Bundled Server**: Optionally run your Stump server from the app itself, so you don't need to configure one separately
- **Multiple Instances**: Connect to as many Stump instances as you want, all from the same app
