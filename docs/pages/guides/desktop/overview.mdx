# Desktop App

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
	This functionality is not yet fully tested, and no official releases are available. If you are on
	macOS or Linux, you can build the desktop app from sources. I'll sometimes provide a build when
	asked on Discord, but no promises ðŸ˜‰

The very same app you use in your browser, but with a few added features.

## What is the difference between the web UI and the desktop app?

The biggest difference is that the desktop app is a **standalone** application, where it only needs to know _where_ your Stump instance is to function how you expect it to.

At the time of writing, there are only few desktop-only features, but more are planned. For now, the desktop app provides:

- Optional Discord Rich Presence integration
- Optional bundling of a Stump instance within the app, itself. This means the app functions as your server, too.
