# Desktop App

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
	This app is still in development, and is not yet available for download. I expect an initial
	release to be available towards the end of 2024 for macOS and Linux users. Unfortunately, Windows
	users will have to wait a little longer (see [#219](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/219))
</Callout>

The very same app you use in your browser, but with added features:

- **Standalone**: No need to keep a browser tab open
- **Discord Rich Presence**: Show off what you're doing in Stump to your friends, if you want
- **Bundled Server**: Optionally run your Stump server from the app itself, so you don't need to configure one separately
  - Note: This feature is not recommended yet unless you will be accessing Stump solely from the desktop app. This will be improved in the future to access it from the browser as well
- **Multiple Instances**: Connect to as many Stump instances as you want, all from the same app
