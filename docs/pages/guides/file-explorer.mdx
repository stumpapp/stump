## Accessing a File Explorer

<Callout emoji="🔐">
	This functionality is gated behind the `file:explorer` user permission. To learn more about
	permissions, see the [Permissions](/guides/access-control/permissions) guide.

Generally, you can access a file explorer by clicking on the `Files` tab in an entity's page. This will render the file explorer for that entity, which effectively is just sets the root directory of the file explorer to the entity's path.
