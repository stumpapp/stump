KoReader is an open-source e-reader application that supports a variety of devices. Stump has a built-in implementation of the [sync API](https://github.com/koreader/koreader-sync-server) that enables KoReader to sync read progress with Stump.

## How it works

KoReader sync works by sending read progress updates to Stump. When you open and progress through a book in KoReader, it will send a request to Stump with KoReader-specific information for tracking your progress:

- A hash of the book, which is used to identify the book between KoReader and Stump
- The progress string (x-pointer) that KoReader uses for tracking where you are in a book with more precision for DOM-based documents
- A percentage of how far you are through the book
- The ID of the device you are using

Stump will store this information to perform various progress-related lookups when KoReader issues requests.

## Setup

To set up KoReader sync with Stump, you need to:

<Steps>

### Install [KoReader](https://koreader.rocks/) on your device

### Enable the KoReader routes on your Stump instance

The KoReader router is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to set the `ENABLE_KOREADER_SYNC` environment variable to `true`, or directly set `enable_koreader_sync=true` in the `Stump.toml` configuration file.

See the [configuration guide](/guides/configuration/server-options) for more information.

### Ensure your library generates KoReader-compatible book hashes

KoReader uses a hash of the book to identify it between KoReader and Stump. Stump implements a port of the KoReader hash generation algorithm, but it will not be generated by default.

To enable this feature, be sure the `KoReader-compatible hashes` setting is enabled for a library. For more information, see the [scanner configuration](/guides/basics/scanner) guide.

### Generate an API key

<Callout emoji="🔐">This step requires the `feature:api_keys` user permissions.</Callout>

The API key should have at least the `feature:koreader_sync` permission:

1. Navigate to the app settings (`/settings/app`)
2. Click the `API keys` tab (`/settings/app/api-keys`)
3. Click the `Create API key` button
4. Create your key and save the full value after creation

### Configure a sync server in KoReader

1. Open KoReader on your device
2. Navigate to `Progress sync` > `Custom sync server`
3. Enter the following URL structure:

   ```bash
   http(s)://your-server(:port)(/baseUrl)/koreader/:api_key
   ```

</Steps>

## Future improvements

While the KoReader sync integration is functional, there are a few improvements that could be made:

1. **Device management**: The devices are not surfaced on the UI yet. I'd like to add functions to attach friendly names to devices so you can easily identify them (e.g. `Aaron's Kobo Clara`)
2. **Progress translation**: The progress data which gets stored is primarily for KoReader's use, with the exception of the percentage. I'd like to add a feature to translate the x-pointer into a proper epubcfi so the native Stump reader can pick up where you left off
