KoReader is an open-source e-reader application that supports a variety of devices. Stump has a built-in implementation of the [sync API](https://github.com/koreader/koreader-sync-server) that enables KoReader to sync read progress with Stump.

## Setup

To set up KoReader sync with Stump, you'll need to do the following:

1. Install KoReader on your device
2. Enable the koreader routes on your Stump instance
3. Generate an API key with at least the `feature:koreader_sync` permission (implies you have the `feature:api_keys` permission for your account)
4. Configure Stump as a sync server in KoReader

The URL structure for informing KoReader of your Stump server is:

```bash
http(s)://your-server(:port)(/baseUrl)/koreader/:api_key
```
