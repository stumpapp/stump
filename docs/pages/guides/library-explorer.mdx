The library explorer is a tool built into the built-in web client that allows you to browse the contents of a library directly as it is stored on disk.

To access the library explorer, click the "Library Explorer" button in the options dropdown for a given library. Or, you can navigate directly to `/library/<library id>/explore` in your browser.
