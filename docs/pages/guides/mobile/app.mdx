# Mobile App

<Callout emoji="🚧">
	A mobile app is currently in a **PoC** (proof of concept) stage. This section of the documentation
	will be built out as development progresses, but please be aware as you read through this page
	that things are subject to change or might not be fully implemented yet.
</Callout>

## Supported Platforms

The mobile app is being developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), which enables support for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. This is mostly to reduce the overhead of maintaining two separate codebases.

## Planned Features

The mobile app will be a bit more trimmed down in scope compared to the built in web app, but will aim to provide a more focused experience that is particularly tailored to on-the-go, mobile use cases. Here are some of the planned features:

- Multi-server configurations, in case you have multiple Stump instances to swap between
- OPDS support, so you can use the app with other OPDS-compatible services (e.g., [Kavita](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/))
- Readers for the supported book formats (e.g., CBZ/CBR, EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- Offline reading support so you don't need an active connection to your Stump/OPDS instance(s)

## Contributing

If you are a mobile developer and would like to help out, please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as)! There is no official project or roadmap yet, but I'm happy to discuss the current state of the app and what needs to be done.

I'm also open to suggestions and ideas, so feel free to share your thoughts! You don't need to be a developer to contribute effectively.

## Considerations

React Native is often criticized for its performance and reliability, but it has come a long way since its inception. Stump is primarily developed and maintained by a single person, so it is important to consider the trade-offs between performance and development overhead.

Regardless, I am confident that it is at least a good fit for Stump, as it is a relatively simple app with a focus on content consumption - which doesn't inherently require a lot of performance.
