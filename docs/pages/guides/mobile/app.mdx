# Mobile App

<Callout emoji="🚧">
	A mobile app is currently in a **PoC** (proof of concept) stage. Please be aware that these
	sections of the documentation subject to change or might not be fully implemented yet
</Callout>

The mobile app is being developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), which enables support for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. This is mostly to reduce the overhead of maintaining two separate codebases.

## Planned Features

The mobile app will be a bit more trimmed down in scope compared to the built in web app, but will aim to provide a more focused experience tailored to on-the-go, mobile use cases. Here are some of the planned features:

<br />

- [x] Multi-server configurations
- [x] OPDS support, so you can use the app with other OPDS-compatible services
- [ ] Readers for the supported book formats (e.g., CBZ/CBR, EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- [ ] Offline reading so you don't need an active internet connection

	[Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as)!
</Callout>

## Alpha Testing

The app is currently available for alpha testing on both iOS and Android. Apple users can test via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/a4srR634). I only have access to a closed beta on Google Play, so if you're interested in testing on Android, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as)!

	Please remember that the app is in a **PoC** stage, so there will be bugs and missing features.
	Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

## Contributing

If you are a mobile developer and would like to help out, please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as)! There is no official project or roadmap yet, but I'm happy to discuss the current state of the app and what needs to be done.
