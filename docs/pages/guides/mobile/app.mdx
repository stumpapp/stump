# Mobile App

<Callout emoji="🚧">
	A mobile app is currently in a **PoC** (proof of concept) stage. Please be aware that these
	sections of the documentation subject to change or might not be fully implemented yet
</Callout>

The mobile app is being developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), which enables support for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. This is mostly to reduce the overhead of maintaining two separate codebases.

## Planned Features

The mobile app will be a bit more trimmed down in scope compared to the built in web app, but will aim to provide a more focused experience tailored to on-the-go, mobile use cases. Here are some of the planned features:

<br />

- [x] Multi-server configurations
- [x] OPDS support, so you can use the app with other OPDS-compatible services
- [ ] Readers for the supported book formats (e.g., CBZ/CBR, EPUB, PDF, etc.)
- [ ] Offline reading so you don't need an active internet connection

## Alpha Testing

## Contributing

If you are a mobile developer and would like to help out, please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as)! There is no official project or roadmap yet, but I'm happy to discuss the current state of the app and what needs to be done.

## FAQ

### Pricing

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
	The price has yet to be determined and **subject to change**
</Callout>

The app will remain free for alpha testers, via TestFlight and Google Play. Once the app is more stable and feature-complete, it will be released as a paid app on both platforms. The price is still to be determined, but it will be a one-time purchase with **no required recurring fees or subscriptions** that otherwise gate features.

There is an actual, monetary, developer cost associated with maintaining the app on both platforms - looking at **you** Apple - so the price will be set to ideally cover those costs over time.

### Why React Native?

React Native is often criticized for its performance and reliability, but it has come a long way since its inception. Stump is primarily developed and maintained by a single person, so it is important to consider the trade-offs between performance and development overhead.

Regardless, I am confident that it is at least a good fit for Stump, as it is a relatively simple app with a focus on content consumption - which doesn't inherently require a lot of performance.

### Why OPDS v2?

I recognize that there are many OPDS v1.2-compatible servers out there, and OPDS v2.0 is not widely adopted yet.

However, I **really** don't like XML - at least not from the perspective of a developer. I don't want to have to maintain an XML client for the app, there are lots of really great v1.2-compatible apps out there, so I'm only supporting OPDS v2.0.

That said, I will consider outside contributions that successfully wrangle v1.2 vs v2.0 client-side negotiations without breakage. Please reach out if you're interested in contributing!

### Will there be translations?

Yes! The app will be translated into multiple languages in the same way the web app is.
