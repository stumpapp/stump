Frequently asked questions about the mobile app

## Pricing

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
	The price has yet to be determined and **subject to change**
</Callout>

The app will remain free for alpha testers via TestFlight and Google Play. Once the app is more stable and feature-complete, it will be released as a paid app on both platforms. The price is not finalized, but it will be a one-time purchase with **no required recurring fees or subscriptions** that otherwise gate features.

## Why React Native?

React Native is often criticized for its performance and reliability, but it has come a long way since its inception. Stump is primarily developed and maintained by a single person, so it is important to consider the trade-offs between performance and development overhead.

Regardless, I am confident that it is at least a good fit for Stump, as it is a relatively simple app with a focus on content consumption - which doesn't inherently require a lot of performance.

## Why OPDS v2?

I recognize that there are many OPDS v1.2-compatible servers out there, and OPDS v2.0 is not widely adopted yet.

However, I **really** don't like XML - at least not from the perspective of a developer. I don't want to have to maintain an XML client for the app. There are lots of really great v1.2-compatible apps out there, so I'm only supporting OPDS v2.0.

That said, I will consider outside contributions that successfully wrangle v1.2 vs v2.0 client-side negotiations without breakage. Please reach out if you're interested in contributing!

## Will there be translations?

Yes! The app will be translated into multiple languages in the same way the web app is. I plan to start this effort once the app is more stable and feature-complete.
