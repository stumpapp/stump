The mobile app doesn't yet support all the formats that your Stump server supports. The following table provides an overview of formats and their status:

| Format  | Status | Notes                             |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| CBZ/ZIP | ✅     |                                   |
| CBR/RAR | ✅     |                                   |
| EPUB    | ⚠️     | Poor UX, not yet suitable for use |
| PDF     | ⚠️     | Some PDF pages are blurry         |

## OPDS Formats

You may download books from your OPDS catalogs and read them offline, however only some formats support a streaming reader. The following table provides an overview of formats and their status:

| Format  | Streaming | Notes                     |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| CBZ/ZIP | ✅        |                           |
| CBR/RAR | ✅        |                           |
| EPUB    | ❌        | Support in the future     |
| PDF     | ⚠️        | Some PDF pages are blurry |

## Reader Preferences

Each reader has specific settings and preferences that are configurable. These settings may be set globally for all books, and overridden on a per-book basis. If you change a setting for a specific book, it will only apply to that book.

There are a few settings that are common to all readers:

### Incognito

When enabled, the app will not save your reading progress. This wouldnt affect bookmarks or annotations, just the progress of the book.

### Reading Direction

You may set `LTR` (left-to-right) or `RTL` (right-to-left) reading direction.

### Reading Timer

When enabled, the app will track the time you spend reading each book in seconds. This will even sync across devices!

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
	The app supports reading timers for all server configurations, but syncing is only available when
	using a Stump server
</Callout>

#### Disabling

If you disable the reading timer while reading a book, it is effectively pausing the timer. If you re-enable it, the timer will resume from where it left off. If you disable the timer globally and start reading a book, the timer will not start.

#### Resetting

You may reset the reading timer for a book at any time. This will reset the timer to 0 seconds
