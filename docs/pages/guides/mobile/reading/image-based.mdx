# Comics, Manga, and Image-based Reading

Any format that is image-based will generally use the same image-based reader. This includes formats like `.cbz`/`.zip` and `.cbr`/`.rar` files that contain images of the pages. PDF files are considered here as well, at least from Stump server sources.

## Layout

The image-based reader has an overlay that presents when you click the center-portion of the screen. This overlay consists of 3 main sections:

1. The header, which contains an <InlineIconButton ><X /></InlineIconButton> to exit the reader, and a <InlineIconButton ><CircleEllipsis /></InlineIconButton> to open the quick settings menu
2. A center, gradient-filled area that you may tap to close the overlay
3. The footer, which contains controls for navigation and information about the position and reading progress

## Preferences

The following preferences are available for the image-based reader:

### Flow

The image-based reader has a few flows that you can use to customize your reading experience:

- Paged
- Horizontal scroll
- Vertical scroll

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
	Image zooming is funky when using the horizontal scroll flow. This is a known issue and will be
	addressed in a future release
</Callout>

### Image Options

There are a few options specific to the images rendered you can adjust

#### Cache Policy

You may specify a policy of either `Memory & Disk` (default), `Disk`, `Memory`, or `None`. This is exposed in case you have specific performance needs (or leeway) for your device. While `None` is available, it is not recommended.

#### Double Paged

You may specify a double page behavior of:

- `Auto` (default) - The app will attempt to use double pages when possible (i.e. when device is landscape)
- `Always` - Always use double pages, scaling the images to fit the screen
- `Off` - Never use double pages

#### Image Scaling

You may specify an image scaling behavior of:

- `Fit Width` (default) - The image will be scaled to fit the width of the screen
- `Fit Height` - The image will be scaled to fit the height of the screen
- `None` - The image will be displayed at its original size

	This setting is not yet available and subject to change
</Callout>

### Navigation

#### Tap Sides to Navigate

You may enable this setting to navigate to the next or previous page by tapping the left or right side of the screen, abiding by the reading direction.

#### Bottom Controls

The app supports two different bottom control layouts:

1. Slider - A slider that you can drag to navigate through the book. An image preview will be displayed as you drag
2. Image Gallery - A swipeable gallery of thumbnails that you can tap to navigate to a specific page
