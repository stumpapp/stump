# Readers

The mobile app provides a few different readers with unique experiences tailored to the format of the book you're reading

## Comics / Manga / Image-based Books

Any format that is image-based will generally use the same image-based reader. This includes formats like `.cbz`/`.zip` and `.cbr`/`.rar` files that contain images of the pages. PDF files are considered here as well, at least from Stump server sources.

### Presets

The image-based reader has a few presets that you can use to customize your reading experience:

1. Horizontal paged swipe (default, `ltr` or `rtl`)
2. Horizontal continuous scroll (`ltr` or `rtl`)
3. Vertical continuous scroll (`ttb` or `btt`)

There are plans to add more customizations in the future, however these are the presets that are available at the time of writing.

### Incognito Mode

The image-based reader can be used in incognito mode, which will not save your reading progress. When enabled, no progress-related API calls will be made to the server.

## Ebook Reader

	The ebook reader provides really poor UX. It is recommended to use a different reader until this
	is improved. It is planned for a future release!

> Documentation will be added when the reader is improved
