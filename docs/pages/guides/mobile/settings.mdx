# App Settings

The mobile app has a few settings that you can configure to your liking. These settings are stored locally on your device and are not synced across devices.

## Preferences

You may configure basic preferences like the app theme and language. A few non-standard settings are also available:

### Default Server

A quick way to switch the currently configured default server. See the [default server](/guides/mobile/servers#default-server) guide for more information on what that is.

### Debug Settings

A few settings are available to help aid in debugging issues or general privacy. These settings include:

- **Mask URLs**: When enabled, the app will mask URLs in the UI. This is useful for screenshots or screen recordings where you don't want to expose your server URL

## Reader Settings

You may configure global settings for all readers, which can be overridden on a per-book basis. See the [readers](/guides/mobile/reading/readers) guide for more information on what these settings are.

## Data Usage

The app has built-in mechanisms for viewing and managing the data it uses. All data is categorized by server, so you can see how much data each server is using.

### Server Data

Each server generally has the following data categories:

- Downloads (books, images, etc.)
- Preferences (settings, etc.)

You may clear the data for a specific server, or clear all data for all servers
