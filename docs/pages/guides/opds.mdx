# OPDS

Open Publication Distribution System ([OPDS](https://opds.io/)) is a specification for generating and serving catalogs of digital content. It is used by many applications, such as [Panels](https://panels.app/) and [Chunky Reader](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chunky-comic-reader/id663567628).

So long as an OPDS client _properly_ implements the OPDS specification, you should be able to use it with Stump. Each OPDS client might have a different way of collecting this information during their onboarding steps. If you have any trouble using your preferred client, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/new/choose) or feel free to pop into the [Discord](https://discord.gg/63Ybb7J3as) for help. This page can be updated with your findings to help others in the future.

## Supported OPDS Versions

Stump fully supports OPDS 1.2 and has experimental support for 2.0. At the time of writing, there are few clients which actually support 2.0, so it is difficult to test. If you have any experiences with OPDS 2.0, please consider updating this page with your findings!

### OPDS 1.2

The general structure of the URL to connect to your Stump server is:

`http(s)://your-server(:10801)(/baseUrl)/opds/v1.2/catalog`

## Using an API Key

<Callout emoji="🔐">
	This functionality is gated behind the `feature:api_keys` user permission. To learn more about
	permissions, see the [permissions](/guides/access-control/permissions) guide.
</Callout>

There is a special router for OPDS v1.2 that allows you to embed an API key in the URL directly. This is primarily only done to support clients which do not support passing auth credentials in the request headers. The URL structure for this is:

`http(s)://your-server(:10801)(/baseUrl)/opds/(api_key)/v1.2/catalog`

For additional information on API keys, see the [API keys](/guides/features/api-keys) guide.
