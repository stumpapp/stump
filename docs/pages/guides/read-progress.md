# Read Progress

Stump keeps track of your reading progress: which books you have read, which books you are currently reading, etc. This is done on a _per-user_ basis, meaning that each user has their own set of progresses for the books they read on the server.

Read progress through Stump is only tracked for books you read using Stump's built-in readers. Most other reading clients will have their own mechanisms for tracking read progress, which is likely not compatible to sync with Stump.
