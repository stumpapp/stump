# Series

The most important takeaway from this section is that **series are just folders** on your file system that live within the path of a library.

## What defines a series?

A series is actually dependent on how its library is configured. A library can be configured to support 2 different patterns:

- **Collection based library**: Takes the top most folder and collapses everything into it as a single series.
- **Series Based Library**: Takes the bottom most folders as series, effectively being the opposite of a collection based library.

For more information on these patterns, please review the [Library Configuration](/guides/libraries#library-patterns) section of the documentation.
