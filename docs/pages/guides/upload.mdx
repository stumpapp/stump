# Uploading Books

Stump has an opt-in feature that allows your users to upload books to your server.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
	This functionality allows files to be uploaded to your server, so it should be used with caution.
	This feature must be manually enabled by the server owner by setting the `enable_upload`
	configuration variable to `true`.
</Callout>

## Enabling upload

Uploading is **disabled by default**, and is gated behind the `enable_upload` configuration variable (`true` enables uploading). This variable can be set by modifying your `Stump.toml` file to set `enable_upload = true` or by setting the environment variable `STUMP_ENABLE_UPLOAD=true`.

When uploading is not enabled, the routes for uploading **will not be attached to your server** and, consequently, the web UI **will not show the upload interface**. Attempting to upload directly through the API will result in HTTP Error 404.

### Permissions

Only users with permission to upload are allowed to add files to the server. Users will need the following permissions:

- `file:upload`
- `manage:library`

The server owner can assign these permissions to users on the user management settings page. For more information on that process, see the [user permissions](/guides/access-control/permissions) guide.

### Configuration

The server limits the maximum upload size based on your configuration, you can change `max_file_upload_size` in `Stump.toml` or the `STUMP_MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` environment variable to set the maximum allowed upload size **in bytes**.

## How it works

This feature allows users to upload books or an entire collection of files and directories via series upload. To use it, navigate to the "Files" menu for a library and click the <InlineIcon><Upload/></InlineIcon> icon to open the upload dropdown. Select "Add books" to upload one or more book files. Select "Add series" to upload a single `.zip` archive containing the content you wish to upload.

After an upload finishes, a library scan will automatically be started to add the newly uploaded books.

### Uploading books

This menu is accessed from "<InlineIcon><BookPlus/></InlineIcon> Add books" in the upload dropdown. It allows users to upload one or more book files (e.g., `.cbz`, `.cbr`, `.epub`, and `.pdf` files) to a specific library directory.

<Steps>

<h3>Add books</h3>

Drag and drop one or more book files into the drop zone or click the drop zone to browse to the files you want to add.

<h3>Review the books you want to add</h3>

Review the list of books you have chosen to add in the "Added files" list below the dropzone.

If you added a file that you do not want to upload, you can remove it by clicking on "Remove" to the right of the file info.

<h3>Click "Upload" to begin the upload!</h3>

Clicking "Upload" starts your upload. Watch the corner of the screen for a toast confirming that your upload was successful.

</Steps>

### Uploading series

This menu is accessed from "<InlineIcon><FolderPlus/></InlineIcon> Add series" in the upload dropdown. It allows users to upload a `.zip` file containing multiple books, images, or metadata in an arbitrary directory structure. The archive will be extracted to the location specified when uploading.

<Steps>

<h3>Add a zip file</h3>

Drag and drop one `.zip` file onto the drop zone or click the drop zone to browse to the zip archive you want to add.

<h3>Enter a name for the series</h3>

Enter a name for the series below the drop zone. This is the name of the directory to which your zip archive will be unpacked.

<h3>Confirm the zip file you want to add</h3>

Confirm that you added the right file in the "Added files" list below the "Series name" field.

If you added a file that you do not want to upload, you can remove it by clicking on "Remove" to the right of the file info and select a new file.

<h3>Click "Upload" to begin the upload!</h3>

Clicking "Upload" starts your upload. Watch the corner of the screen for a toast confirming that your upload was successful.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

This section provides explanations for possible errors you may encounter when uploading files.

### 400 Bad request

A bad request error will be returned if the request includes disallowed files or attempts to access a path outside the library for which the upload is intended.

### 401 Unauthorized

This error indicates that the user attempting to upload files does not have the required `file:upload` or `manage:library` permissions.

### 404 Not found

This error may indicate that uploading has not been enabled for your server. Double check that you have `enable_upload = true` in your `Stump.toml` or `STUMP_ENABLE_UPLOAD = true` set in your environment.

### 413 Payload too large

The uploaded files exceeded your configured maximum upload size. Consider increasing the value of `max_file_upload_size` in `Stump.toml` or changing the value of the `STUMP_MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` environment variable.

## Security considerations

Stump attempts to validate uploads in order to protect the host system from misuse of upload functionality, but it should be used with care. The following section describes the validation Stump applies to incoming upload requests.

### Validations

- File type: Only certain file types are permitted in uploads.
  - Books: Only `.cbr`, `.cbz`, `.epub`, and `.pdf` files are allowed.
  - Series: Only `.zip` archives can be uploaded.
    - The contents of the archive must also be limited to: `.cbr`, `.cbz`, `.epub`, `.pdf`, `.xml`, `.json` and image file types.
- Content-Type: The server attempts to validate content-type of uploads to reject anything not matching the files above.
- Path validation: The server will not allow uploads outside the library for which they are intended, and special path components like `..` will be rejected entirely.
- Overwrite protection: An upload cannot overwrite an existing file.

It may be possible to construct input that circumvents this validation. Server owners are encouraged to only enable this functionality if they need it and to only allow trusted users permission to upload files.
