<Steps>
### Download the latest release

Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/releases) and download the latest release for macOS. It will be a single `.zip` file named according to your processor architecture:

- `stump-<version>-macos-intel.zip`
- `stump-<version>-macos-arm.zip`

### Unzip the file

Unzip the downloaded file using your preferred method. The expected contents are:

- `stump_server` (the binary executable file)
- `client` (a folder containing all of the webapp files)

These can live wherever you'd like, so long as they are adjacent to each other. For example, if you wanted them in your home directory, you could run:

```bash copy
unzip ~/Downloads/stump-<version>-macos-arm.zip -d ~
```

### Make the binary executable

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the `stump` binary. Run the following command to make the binary executable:

```sh copy
# Navigate to the folder containing the stump binary, e.g., ~/Stump
sudo chmod +x stump_server
```

### Run the binary

You can now run the `stump` binary from the terminal:

```bash copy
# Navigate to the folder containing the stump binary, e.g., ~/Stump, or be sure to include the full path to the binary
./stump_server
```
