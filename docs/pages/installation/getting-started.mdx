I am working on putting together a hosted demo of Stump. If it is available, you will find it at [demo.stumpapp.dev](https://demo.stumpapp.dev). The login credentials are:

- **Username:** `demouser`
- **Password:** `demouser10801`

## Installation methods

There are three ways to install Stump:

1. Install Stump using [Docker](/installation/docker)
2. Install a [pre-compiled](/installation/executable) binary for your operating system
3. Install Stump from [source](/installation/source)

At the time of writing, only the Docker installation is _readily_ available. No pre-compiled binaries are available yet.
You may install Stump from source, but the process is not yet _fully_ documented, so please keep that in mind.

If you go through any of these installation methods and experience issues, or just want to improve the existing documentation, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/new).
