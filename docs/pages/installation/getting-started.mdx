# Getting Started

<Callout emoji="🚧">

	and feel free to [open an issue]( https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/new/choose) if you
	encounter any problems or inconsistencies
</Callout>

## Demo

A demo can be found at [demo.stumpapp.dev](https://demo.stumpapp.dev). The login credentials are:

- **Username:** `demouser`
- **Password:** `demouser10801`

I try to keep the demo up to date, but it may not always be the case.

## Installation methods

There are three ways to install Stump:

1. Install using [Docker](/installation/docker)
2. Install from a [pre-compiled](/installation/executable) binary
3. Install directly from [source](/installation/source)

If you go through any of these installation methods and experience issues, or just want to improve the existing documentation, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/new).
