## Installation methods

There are three ways to install Stump:

1. Install using [Docker](/installation/docker)
2. Install from a [pre-compiled](/installation/executable) binary
3. Install directly from [source](/installation/source)

If you go through any of these installation methods and experience issues, or just want to improve the existing documentation, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stumpapp/stump/issues/new).
