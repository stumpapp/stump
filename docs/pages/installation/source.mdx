# Source Code Installation

If you want to install Stump directly from source, you will need to first follow the steps outlined in the [developer guide](/contributing), as it very closely aligns with this installation process.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
	Once a stable release is available, the only difference will be to **not** switch to the develop
	branch unless you actively want a more 'nightly' version of Stump.
</Callout>

Once you have finished that initial setup, you can run the following command to build Stump locally:

```bash
moon run web:build server:build # build:desktop for the desktop app
```

This will bundle the web application and build the Stump server. The server binary is located at `target/release/stump_server`, and the web bundle at `apps/web/dist`. You can place those two items anywhere you'd like, just be sure they are either next to each other or you have set the appropriate [environment variable](/guides/configuration#stump_client_dir).
