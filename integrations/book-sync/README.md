# Stump Book Sync

This is a standalone service that synchronizes books from a host machine to a remote which is running a Stump instance.

## How it works

The service watches a directory on the host machine for changes and synchronizes the books to the remote Stump instance via upload operations available in the Stump API. This means **you must have upload enabled on your Stump instance**.

TODO: Add more details on how it works and all that jazz once it actually works
