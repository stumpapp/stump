# Components

This package is the component library used throughout the Stump web and desktop apps. A vast majority of the foundational components come from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), a wonderful free and open source collection of React components build with [radix-ui](https://radix-ui.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Huge thanks to [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn) for their work!

## Usage

When developing components within this package, it is really useful to have the Storybook running. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
# Using yarn from the package root directory
yarn run storybook
```

## Structure

The components are organized and grouped into folders based on their most abstracted use case / category. For example, all variants of a button are grouped together in the `button` folder. This is to make it easier to find the component you are looking for, as well as to group the Storybook stories together in the same way you would find them in the Storybook UI.
